    "# AE2 - Data Analysis\n",
    "Conduct an analysis of the coverage and performance of fixed broadband in the UK between the years 2018-2024. The rollout of fibre-broadband in the country has been hailed as a successful intervention by the market regulator OFCOM. Look at recent reports by OFCOM’s [Connected Nations 2024](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-and-broadband/coverage-and-speeds/connected-nations-2024) before you start your assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contains:\n",
    "- OFCOM Connected Nations Data (2018-2024)\n",
    "  a. Coverage data (separate files for each year)\n",
    "  b. Performance data (separate files for each year)\n",
    "  c. Contains Local Authority District codes in the `laua` column\n",

    "  a. Maps local authority data to broader geographic regions\n",
    "  b. Contains `LAD24NM` column for matching with OFCOM data\n",
    "  c. Aggregate regions and countries using the `RGN24NM` and `CTRY24NM` columns\n",

    "You are required to produce analysis that encompasses data for all the years in the provided CSV files. You must make distinctions between the separate datasets provided for coverage and performance.\n",

    "## Assessment Criteria\n",
    "Analyse the dataset to find any trends and comparisons. You must demonstrate four different forms of analysis using techniques covered in the course using only the datasets described, these should be described as questions you are asking about the data. See the assessment brief for more details."
